# XMuST-GCNN: eXplainable Multimodal Spatio-Temporal Graph Convolutional Neural Network  

> **ICASSP 2026 Submission**  
> A novel framework for modeling **heterogeneous clinical data** with multimodal graph neural networks, balancing performance and interpretability.

## ðŸŒŸ Highlights  

- **Multimodal fusion**: Combines sequential (time-varying) and static (time-invariant) patient data.  
- **Spatio-temporal graphs**: Model irregular multivariate time series via dynamic graph construction.  
- **Parallel static graph**: Encode demographic + invariant features.  
- **Gated attention mechanism**: Learns how to balance contributions from temporal and static modalities.  
- **Explainability**: Extension of **GNNExplainer** to multimodal settings, identifying featureâ€“time interactions and static risk factors.  
- **Performance**: Achieved **AUCROC = 82.15 Â± 1.33%** on ICU antimicrobial resistance (AMR) prediction, surpassing strong graph-based baselines by >4 points.
